## User Experience (UX)

### Initial-Project

Starting off as a blogging platform, GoGLobal's main goal shifted towards creating a space where users could connect meaningfully. This involved enabling users to share their experiences, ask questions, and engage in threaded conversations. The underlying purpose was to facilitate a sense of staying connected, as encapsulated by the platform's slogan: *stay connected*.
